## What is this project?
I have created a habit tracker so that users can keep track of habits and other tasks that they want to start doing each day e.g. Go for a 15 minute walk, Drink 2 litres of water.

## What tech stack does the project utilise?
The project utilses NextJS and TailWind for the front-end. It uses NextJS built in API routes to route the api so that there is no need for a dedicated back-end and TailWind allows for simple and efficient UI/UX design. In order to store user data and habits the project uses MongoDB to gain familiarity with NoSQL as the [team-project](https://github.com/EllisOllier/team-project) repository uses PostgreSQL.
