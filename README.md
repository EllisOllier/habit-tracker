## What is this project?
I have created a habit tracker so that users can keep track of habits and other tasks that they want to start doing each day e.g. Go for a 15 minute walk, Drink 2 litres of water.

### What tech stack does the project utilise?
The project utilses NextJS and TailWind for the front-end. It uses NextJS built in API routes to route the api so that there is no need for a dedicated back-end and TailWind allows for simple and efficient UI/UX design. In order to store user data and habits the project uses MongoDB to gain familiarity with NoSQL as the [team-project](https://github.com/EllisOllier/team-project) repository uses PostgreSQL. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
